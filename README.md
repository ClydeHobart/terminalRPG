# terminalRPG

## Overview

This repository is for a yet-to-be-named terminal-based role-playing game that I'm working on. So far I've been drawing inspiration from other RPGs that I've played ([Dungeons & Dragons](http://dnd.wizards.com/), [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim?), [Fallout 4](https://fallout.bethesda.net/games/fallout-4), etc.). Not much is currently fleshed out, but that'll obviously change as time goes on.
